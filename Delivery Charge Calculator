Scenario: Delivery Charge Calculator

An online store wants to calculate the total delivery charge for each customer based on:

 A fixed base charge (`static`) applied to every order.
 A distance-based charge, calculated by multiplying the distance (in km) with a fixed rate per km.
 Each customer has a name and a distance to their location (`instance`).



Task Requirements:

1. Create a class `Delivery`.
2. Declare:

    A static variable `baseCharge = 50`
    Instance variables:
     `String customerName`
     `int distanceInKm`
3. Create a method `int calculateDeliveryCharge()` that:

    Declares a local variable `ratePerKm = 10`
    Calculates `totalCharge = baseCharge + (distanceInKm  ratePerKm)`
    Returns `totalCharge`
4. Create a method `void displayDetails()` that:

    Prints customer name, distance, and total delivery charge.
5. In `main()`, create two customer objects, assign values, and display their details.



 Expected Output Format:


Customer: Arjun
Distance: 5 km
Total Delivery Charge: ₹100

Customer: Sneha
Distance: 10 km
Total Delivery Charge: ₹150
