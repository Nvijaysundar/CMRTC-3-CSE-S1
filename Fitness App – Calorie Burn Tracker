 Scenario: Fitness App – Calorie Burn Tracker

You are building a Fitness Tracking Application to help users monitor their calorie burn during workouts.

Each user:

 Has a name, age, and weight (kg).
 Performs one of the following workouts:

   Running
   Cycling
   Swimming

Each workout type has a fixed MET (Metabolic Equivalent Task) value:

 Running → 9.8
 Cycling → 7.5
 Swimming → 8.3

Calories burned per minute is calculated by the formula:

Calories/min = 0.0175 * MET * weight

To get total calories burned:

Total Calories=Calories/min×Duration (in minutes)


Your Task:

1. Create a class `WorkoutTracker` with appropriate variables.
2. You must decide:

    Which variables should be static, instance, or local.
    How many methods to use to break logic cleanly (e.g., for MET value lookup, calculation, and displaying summary).
3. Allow tracking for multiple users with different workouts and durations.
4. Display the workout summary in the following format:

User: Neha
Workout: Running
Weight: 60.0 kg
Duration: 30 minutes
Calories Burned: 308.7
