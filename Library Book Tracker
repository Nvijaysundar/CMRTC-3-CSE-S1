Scenario: "Library Book Tracker"

 The city library has many books. Every book has:

  A title and book ID (different for every book).
  All books belong to the same library name (e.g., “City Central Library”).
  The system should also show the current year when the book is being added.

Task: Write a simple Java program using a class called `Book` that:

 Uses a static variable for the library name (same for all books).
 Uses instance variables for book title and book ID.
 Uses a local variable inside `main()` to represent the current year.
 Create 2 books with different details and print all information for both.

Hint:

 Use `Book` class with `String title`, `int bookId` as instance variables.
 Use `static String libraryName = "City Central Library";`
 In `main()`, create 2 `Book` objects and set values using dot notation.
 Use a local variable like `int currentYear = 2025;` to show the year.


 Expected Output Format:

Library: City Central Library
Book Title: Java Basics
Book ID: 101
Year: 2025

Library: City Central Library
Book Title: Python Guide
Book ID: 102
Year: 2025
