1. Toll Booth System – Advanced Traffic Analytics

 Scenario:

A toll plaza has multiple booths. Each booth records:

* Car count
* Truck count
* Shift duration (in hours)
* Toll per vehicle (₹50 for cars, ₹100 for trucks)

The system must:

* Calculate:

  * Total revenue
  * Vehicles per hour
  * Revenue per hour
  * Average toll per vehicle
  * Peak hour detection: If vehicles/hour > 10 → Mark as "Peak Hour Load"

* Categorize booth performance using a switch:

  * If revenue > ₹2000 → "Excellent"
  * ₹15002000 → "Good"
  * ₹10001500 → "Average"
  * Else → "Low"

Booth 1  Cars: 20, Trucks: 10, Shift: 4 hrs
  Total Revenue: ₹2000
