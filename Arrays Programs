Problem 1 : The Lost Parcel Tag
A courier company assigns unique tracking numbers from 1 to N for each parcel. However, during an audit, one of the tags went missing. You are given an array of size N−1 that contains all tags except the missing one. Your task is to find the missing tag using only array operations. You are not allowed to use any additional data structures like hash maps or sets.
Objective:
 Determine the missing number in a sequence from 1 to N using only array operations.
Input:
●	First line: Integer N — the total number of parcels.

●	Second line: N−1 space-separated integers — the available tracking numbers.

Output:
●	A single integer — the missing tracking number.

Constraints:
●	2 ≤ N ≤ 1000

●	1 ≤ tracking[i] ≤ N

●	All numbers are distinct

●	Exactly one number between 1 and N is missing

Your task is to reverse the order of the array in-place (i.e., without using extra arrays or data structures).
Objective:
 Given an array of N integers, reverse the array in-place using only array operations.
Input:
●	First line: Integer N — the number of boxes on the conveyor
